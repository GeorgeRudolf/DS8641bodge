Stab a current replacement part for dead bus transceivers on your DEC cards with this ugly adapter


You stick gerbers on a PCB factory website. Boards arrive. You stick SN75138s or 26S10s on the boards, and the boards on your broken DEC modules.
It's really that simple.

Sorry, the SOIC footprint is really narrow and may be fiddly to solder, and the pins are a biiiit wider than the actual DIP footprint should be - this is so that the wrong pads on the two footprints don't short against each other due to insufficient clearance. Make sure no solder bridges are left.
